# CS-439-Finite-State-Lab

Introduction:

This project is a choose your own adventure game that explores a persons first experience with alcoohol.
It delves into different levels of alcohol consumption and how that can affect you. It also deals with
the consequences of too much alcohol. There are many notes about the dangers of alcohol and encourages
those who are struggling with alcoholism to seek help.


Technical Framework:

This was developed in Twine. I used their tools to create a simple choose your adventure game. This was
used for the simplicity of it allowing me to focus more on the content of the story than tons of lines
of coding. It also still has the ability to implement code which I used in the game to update variables
and send the user to different states.

Running The Project:

The project is deployed on github pages. You can play through the game by going into the deployments
tab on this repository and clicking onto the website link. Here is the link provided in case you do
not have access to view the deployments

Node Switching Mechanisms:

There are a few ways that nodes are switched between in this project. There is the simple pressing of
an option which will take you to the node that you have selected. However, there are many nodes that
have conditionals attached to them that may result in different text appearing or being taken to an 
unexpected node. There are 2 variables within the program, drinks and cakeSlicesEaten. As you progress
through the program these can be incremented and depending on the amount of the variables you can be
redirected to different nodes or different text will be prompted. 

Reflection:

I have made a choose your own adventure game in Twine once before for another Andy Harris class. 
In that game I only used the mechanic of going between nodes simply based on what option you choose.
While that can be sufficient, I wanted to explore more features of Twine. I learned that through the
use of variables in my project I was able to have a largely varying story without as many nodes. If I
hadn't used the variables in this project I likely would have had a node for each drink taken or cake
slice eaten and that would have become very messy very fast. It was fun using the variables and I think
it will be a cool mechanic to those who play the game to figure out how many drinks you need to trigger
certain endings since there is no indicator that tells you that you have reached certain thresholds. 
Overall, I expanded my knowledge of state machines and the possibilties of them and how they don't need
to be one dimensional. Having also taken CS 380 it would be interesting to see how my game would be 
mapped out in something like a finite state automata.

Proud Points:

I was quite proud of the message of the story. While the focus of this project isn't necessarily in
the content of the story, I think alcoholism is a huge problem in society and this game could be turned
into something to help those struggling to realize they have fallen into alcoholism. 

I also am proud of the use of variables in the project. I didn't use any variables last time I made a game
in Twine so this was a fun experience. I believe I used them in a way that truly can simulate the effects
of alcohol in real life. When playing the game the user can just spam click the button to keep getting
more dirnks then all of a sudden they pass out drunk. This can be similar to real life as sometimes the
alcohol will just creep up on you before you truly notice. I think this is a really fun mechanic for the
players to explore to get all the different endings. Also don't eat all the cake...

Potential future features:

One thing that would have been nice to do was making the screens of each node a bit more interesting. 
It was all just plain white text throughout the game which can be pretty boring. 

Another part that could have been improved was the middle section of the game could have more content.
I put a lot of the content all in the endings of the game but it could have been spiced up in the middle
rather than just being a complete repeat of the screens each time.

I would have liked to add a storyline where you intereact with other people while drinking
as it could have been interesting to explore an interaction in different ways depending on your
level of alcoohl in your system. 

Lastly, it would be interesting if I made the length of the game longer and implemented a feature that
could reduce your alcoohl content over time if you decide to choose options other than drinking. This
could really help explore the theme of not overdoing it with alcohol and having a good time with it.
